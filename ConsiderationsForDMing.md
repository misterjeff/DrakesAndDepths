# Considerations for DMing

## Setting the stage
- Have a piece of paper for each character folded over the DM screen which has written on both sides (so both players and DM can see):
  - Character name
  - Player name
  - Class
  - AC
  - Passive perception
- Display physical "cheat sheets" which reference useful information about the setting that can be reference by players at any time during play. This prevents the need for players to have to ask for details about certain things when they are brought up in game so that RP or gameplay can flow smoothly. These would include information such as:
  - The name of the world/landmass/country, provinces/counties, townships/cities, landmarks/wonders, and other useful geographical information
    - This is ideally accomplished with a detailed map
  - The names of common groups, guilds, political organizations, etc. and their identifying characteristics
  - The names of prominent NPCs along with their picture and any other pertinent information about them
  - Historical events, lore, mythology, and religious context that may be referenced
  - Significant events that the party or individual PCs have been part of over the course of play

## Things to keep in mind at all times
- The game is not a narrative; it is a series of meaningful experiences that are driven by player actions and loosely guided by high-level plot points.
- Try to work in less utilized aspects of the game (e.g. tools, weight, miscellaneous items, etc.) where such things would be interesting.
- Introduce situations in which PCs are able to utilize aspects of their archetype/class/race/background/etc. that are unique to them (e.g. a Mountain Dwarf using Stonecunning while the party traverses a cave results in the avoidance of an encounter, an NPC approaches a PC who has the Charlatan background and accuses him/her of having cheated them out of money some months ago).
- Be subtle in storytelling. Don’t call attention to everything that is important or explain how certain things/people are connected. Piecing together a plot that you weren’t beat over the head with can be one of the most rewarding feelings; players should have a chance to experience that through gameplay. However, be ok with such things never being discovered or realized by players.
- Use different takes and/or twists on existing stories and folklore to come up with interesting and entertaining subplots (e.g. the crane wife, Külmking, Midsommar) that can be used to more quickly create an environment rich with possibilities for players.
- Try to develop PCs' interactions and relationships with other PCs and NPCs into interesting and meaningful experiences and surprises down the road (e.g. PC meets an attractive random NPC patron at a tavern and exchanges flirtatious comments; several sessions later, the party, while traveling, sees this NPC again along the road, dead and badly beaten with a mark on his/her forehead - maybe the party cares enough to investigate, which could lead to a prepared subplot, maybe they shrug it off).
- Notes should be kept on all NPCs with which any PC has had non-trivial interactions. Not only can this be used to make the world feel more immersive by having the same characters that remember PCs should revisit already-traveled locations but also provides a wealth of opportunities for various plot points to be introduced more naturally (and potentially surprisingly) via characters with which the PCs have some history.
- Take note of how players think of their characters as well as how characters think of themselves (these can sometimes be different). Seek out opportunities to either play into these or challenge them (e.g. a PC prone to schmoozing the other sex could be approached by an unprovoked NPC interested in getting to know the PC better, perhaps even leading to a femme fatale subplot; a PC obsessed with honor could be presented with the opportunity to make a significant self-sacrifice for the greater good). This can allow players to express key traits of their characters without it feeling entirely self-driven.
- In more lighthearted times during gameplay (e.g. partying at a tavern, regrouping at a base, etc.), try to introduce an abrupt change in tone that makes sense (e.g. PC opens the door to a room at the tavern and finds a hanging body, an NPC with which the party is familiar approaches distraught, etc.) This can be done to try to keep players on their toes and hopefully prevent players from feeling like the DM is just waiting on them before getting on with interesting beats. This should not be done if players are engaged in meaningful RP that would be disrupted or lessened by such a tonal shift.
